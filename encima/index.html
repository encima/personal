          Research<br/>
          <p>I am finishing my 3rd year of my PhD, with no idea what happens next. I am researching how the use of environmental knowledge, coupled with knowledge of data that has been collected by sensors, can be used to maximise the efficiency of a wireless sensor network.</p>

          Code<br/>
          <p>I have written some codes in my time. Some good; some not so good. Most of it is on github, other has been shamefully hidden in bitbucket private repos. Back when I had more free time, I had been known to make android apps and put them on the play store.</p>
